        â€”Font End Developer Path Way
    </h2>
    <div class="container">
    <p>The fundamental coding language of becoming a front-end developer is to know HTML,
        CSS, and JavaScript. I took an HTML online course in Summer. We have created an index
        page and styled some site pages. CSS is used to format the paragraph, table, or items created
        from the HTML file.   </p>
    
    <p>CSS is the language that involves a lot of creativity which allows you to
        customize every single block as well as the entire frame of the web page. HTML or CSS are
        easy to master, the web page will still look acceptable even if the code is messy or wrong.
        JavaScript is different. </p>
    
    <p>The language itself is similar to C++, the code needs to be run
        successfully. On the roadmap, we learn HTML first, then CSS, JavaScript is the last one. The
        code of a CSS file relies on the code of the HTML file, and we write the Javascript code
        based on the given CSS code. </p>
